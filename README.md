# Alien-Run
Run with the Alien and and try and beat the high score in this outer space themed endless runner game. 
Created with unity and c#
A detailed word document is attatched and explains what made me choose this project and how I created it.
A Video of the game working and being played is also attatched in the file, showing all the features like longer jumping when button is held down, speeding up after certain milestone, the high score changing after it was beaten It also shows the three bugs in the game, The alien not dying when he hit the bottom, platforms generating merged together and the character falling through the edge of some platforms.
